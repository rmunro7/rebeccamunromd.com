							<strong>Types of therapy</strong>
							<br>
							I am a big believer in therapy. With or without the addition of medication, therapy is a valuable tool in understanding yourself, seeing patterns, and changing the way you view yourself and interact with others. There are many kinds of therapy. At our first session, we can discuss the therapy options that would be most helpful given your individual situation and goals.  Here are some types of therapy I offer:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy): evidence-based therapy for treating anxiety and mood disorders which focuses on the thoughts and beliefs we have and how they impact our behavior. This therapy can last anywhere from 8 to 20+ sessions and usually focuses on a pretty specific problem (fear of public speaking, upcoming flight) but can also cover more broad symptoms (period of depression, difficulty with a relationship, transition points in life). This therapy involves exploring your symptoms, providing psychoeducation about anxiety/depression, completing homework between sessions, and keeping a log of symptoms.
							</li>
							<li>
								Psychodynamic therapy: often a long-term, weekly (or twice weekly) therapy to focus on understanding patterns in your thoughts/behaviors, get curious about where they came from, and question which beliefs and behaviors are helping you and which ones are keeping you stuck. Often patients come with a specific problem they would like to work on (parenting stress, difficulty with a partner, trouble at work, feeling depressed). Sometimes the initial problem is easy to solve, sometimes it takes more work. Psychodynamic therapy often goes beyond solving the initial problem to understanding how this problem came to be and building resilience through curiosity and self-compassion.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							<strong>Payment &amp; Insurance</strong>
							<br>
							I accept BCBSKS insurance. If you have a different insurance, I can provide you with a detailed receipt to submit to your insurance for reimbursement. Below are my private pay rates:

					<section id="contact"> -->

						<strong>Contact Info</strong>
						<br>
						<p>
							If you are interested in establishing care with me, please send me an email with your contact information and we can set up a time for a 15-20 minute phone call. During this phone call, I will ask some questions about your symptoms, medications, history, and goals. This is also a time when you can ask me any questions, and we can decide if it would be helpful to set up an initial session (90 minutes).

							Voicemail: 785-813-1127
						</p>
						<p>
							A note about email/voicemail:
							<br>
							While my email and voicemail are HIPPA secure, please do not use either to send any urgent or time-sensitive information. Keep your email short with contact information, a few lines about the problem, and good times to contact you. I prefer to discuss your symptoms and personal information in-person or by phone, rather than over email / voicemail. For emergencies, please call 911 or go to your nearest emergency room. I check email and voicemail periodically during business hours, and should respond by the next day. 
						</p>
							
						<p>
							<strong>Confidentiality</strong>
							<br>
							All patients have the right to privacy of their medical information. Especially in psychiatry, this privacy is essential for patients to feel safe and explore potentially scary or anxiety-provoking topics.
